# PERSONAL-FOLDER
This repository is a collection of projects I have worked on, both academically during my Computer Systems Engineering studies and professionally through my work experience.  
The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my growth as a developer and engineer, highlighting the technologies I have learned and applied, such as **C, C++, C#, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Unity**.
